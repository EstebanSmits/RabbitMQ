# RabbitMQ
testing capability of RabbitMQ

1. Run Docker-Compose to start up Rabbit MQ
2. Start up Webapi  to have a pad to write with
3. Start console App; it will subscribe to the full queue.

Questions to answer.
What happens if we have multiple applications listening? Same Application listening multiple types?
If there is no subscriber do messages persist?

Differences between a default , topic and a direct exchange?
how can I use EasyNetQ to target those.
